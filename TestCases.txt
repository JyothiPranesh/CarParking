needed and click the button get car slots. This gives the table with the car details and the slots..

We can enter only the numbers in the text box and other data types will throw the error.

There is a remove button provided at each row, next to the car details, clicking the button will remove the respective
entry and makes the car free for the other slots

There is an add button, and text boxes adjacent to it. When we enter the car details like colour and registration no,
